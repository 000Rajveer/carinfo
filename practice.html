<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Dinosaur Game</b> (also known as the <b>Chrome Dino</b>) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. The game was created by members of the Chrome UX team in 2014.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<hr>
<aside>
    <p>When a user attempts to navigate to a web page on Google Chrome while being offline, the browser notifies the user that they are not connected to the Internet, with an illustration of a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex shown on the page.The game can then be launched either by pressing space or ↑ on desktop, or by tapping the dinosaur on Android or iOS mobile devices.  Additionally, the game can be accessed by inputting chrome://dino or chrome://network-error/-106 into the Omnibox.

    During the game, the dinosaur continuously moves from left to right across a black-and-white desert landscape, with the player attempting to avoid oncoming obstacles such as cacti and pterosaurs by jumping or ducking.Pressing space, ↑, or tapping the dinosaur on mobile devices will cause the dinosaur to "leap", while pressing the ↓ key will cause the dinosaur to "crouch". As the game progresses, the speed of play gradually increases until the user hits an obstacle or a pterosaur, prompting an instant game over.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<section id="Size">
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>T.rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. One of the largest and the most complete specimens, nicknamed Sue, is located at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Sue measured 12.3–12.4 m (40.4–40.7 ft) long, was 3.66–3.96 meters (12–13 ft) tall at the hips, and according to the most recent studies, using a variety of techniques, maximum body masses have been estimated approximately 8.4–8.46 metric tons (9.26–9.33 short tons).</p>

<section id="Skull">
    <h3>Skull</h3>
    <p>The largest known T.rex skulls measure up to 1.54 meters (5 ft) in length.Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced weight, as in all carnivorous theropods. In other respects Tyrannosaurus's skull was significantly different from those of large non-tyrannosaurid theropods. It was extremely wide at the rear but had a narrow snout, allowing unusually good binocular vision.</p>
</section>
<section id="Teeth">
    <h3>Teeth</h3>
    <p>The teeth of T.rex displayed marked heterodonty (differences in shape).The premaxillary teeth, four per side at the front of the upper jaw, were closely packed, D-shaped in cross-section, had reinforcing ridges on the rear surface, were incisiform (their tips were chisel-like blades) and curved backwards. The D-shaped cross-section, reinforcing ridges and backwards curve reduced the risk that the teeth would snap when Tyrannosaurus bit and pulled. The remaining teeth were robust, like "lethal bananas" rather than daggers, more widely spaced and also had reinforcing ridges.</p>
</section>
<section id="Skeleton">
    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
    <p>The vertebral column of Tyrannosaurus consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae and five sacral vertebrae. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and could well have varied between individuals but probably numbered at least forty. Sue was mounted with forty-seven of such caudal vertebrae.The neck of T. rex formed a natural S-shaped curve like that of other theropods. </p>
